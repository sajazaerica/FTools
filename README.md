# FTools
There are lots of Fortran tools in this repository, mostly related to the engineering fields
The main difference between this project and the other ones is that it is very easy to use and without any complication.
Most of the packages for Fortran are very complicated and the user would be confused about how to use the package.
But in this package, I have tried to develop everything as clear as possible and include sample codes for each subroutine and function.
Please feel free to contact me by the email below if you have any questions or suggestion about the package.
